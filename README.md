# Flight Designer

Ever want to design a rocket to hit a certain altitude? Certain acceleration profile? Speed? Flight Duration? Cost? This tool is just for you! Using basic design parameters this tool models a basic flight and displays a graph showing altitude vs time

## How to use

Use Python 3 to call flight_designer.py

## Dependancies

* numpy
* pyqt5

## Future Work
